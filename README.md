# Vue 3 + Vite + TailwindCSS + Vuex + Typescript

This is just a template I use that replicates my current work enviornment. Vite is great, but is a bit of a headache to set up. This has Vuex, though I am looking to start using Pinia as soon as possible. I will create another template when I finally get to it. 
Also, this uses Tailwind, but I will be uploading a framework-less version of this template as well.
